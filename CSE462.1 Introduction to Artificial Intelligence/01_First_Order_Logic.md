# FIRST ORDER LOGIC

First Order Logic (FOL) is an important branch of mathematical logic. It allows mathematical representation and inference of objects, relationships between these objects, and properties that apply to objects.

Its basic components are as follows;

- **Variables:** They are expressed with letters such as x, y, z. They can express anything.
- **Functions:** They give another object depending on the given object. For example: FatherOf(x) returns the father of the object x.
- **Relations (Predicates):** They determine the relationship between two objects. For example: LargerThan(x,y) indicates that x is greater than seven.
- **Conjunctions:** ∧ (and), ∨ (or), ¬ (not), → (if), ↔ (if and only if).
- **Universal Quantifier (∀):** It means everyone or everything.
- **Existence Quantifier (∃):** It means at least one.
